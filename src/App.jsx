          <p>
            The solar system consists of the Sun, eight planets, their moons, and various smaller objects like dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets. At its center, the Sun provides the gravitational force that holds everything in orbit and the energy that drives life on Earth. The planets are divided into two groups: the rocky terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and the gas and ice giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, home to icy bodies like Pluto. The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust.
